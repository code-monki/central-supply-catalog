The Central Supply Catalog draws on a wealth of information from the various versions of the Traveller Science Fiction Role-Playing Game (SFRPG) that was originally published by the Games Designers Workshop in the late 1970s. Over the years the game has continued to evolve and continues to provide enjoyment for players young and old. It is a testimony to the timelessness and appeal of adventuring in the far reaches of outer space and will hopefully continue to flourish for many years to come.

The impetus for creating this application came from a desire to give something back to the community. It is the author's hope that it will provide a useful aid to referees and players alike.

- Marc Miller, Far Future Enterprises, who approved of the project and made artwork available as well as providing valuable connections within the community. In many ways, Marc has been one of my gaming heroes for the last 40+ years.
- Robert Eaglestone, who provided content and feedback during the development of the application.
- Thomas Jones-Low and the stewards of the Traveller Wiki, who graciously shared their content.
- Ade Steward and Robert Pearce for their feedback and invaluable insights.
