  "description": "<p><!-- Summary Start -->Self-heating rations which provide convenient, efficient, proper nutrition at the expense of flavor, texture, style, presentation, or other factors.<!-- Summary End --> Lower TL versions are military- grade MREs, which are not heated, or Combat Rations\n\nEmergency rations also tend to not need heating. Standard rations usually include a heated portion and tend to have the best flavor. Very low TL versions include jerky and hard tack, and may tend to omit vital long-term nutrients but will prevent starvation.</p>",
