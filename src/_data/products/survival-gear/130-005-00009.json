  "description": "<p><!-- Summary Start -->A large (2m diameter) plastic sphere with alternating clear and opaque panels, and a small oxygen tank (capable of supporting one person for two hours) for inflation.<!-- Summary End --> Access to the interior is through a conforming plastic seal which functions similarly to an air lock. The bubble can be used for life support in a vacuum (it can be moved by walking on the inside, treadmill fashion), and it can also be used for protection against weather or as a lifeboat on a sea surface.</p>",
