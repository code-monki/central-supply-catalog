  "description": "<p><!-- Summary Start -->The color enhancement cybernetic eye resolves detail at long distances and detects camouflage.<!-- Summary End --> The color enhancement eye was originally developed to aid color-blind patients.  Color hue and intensity are adjusted by increasing or decreasing eyeball pressure by squinting. This version of the cybernetic eye has a single-function and is easily recognizable as a mechanical implant.</p><p> In all cases, the cyber eye also includes basic visible light vision. For Sophonts with different visual ranges the basic cyber eye will cover their normal visual range.</p>",
