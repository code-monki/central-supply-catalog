  "description": "<p><!-- Summary Start -->Thermeld comes in 15cm long x 5cm wide x 3 cm deep strips of mildly flexible bright pink putty-like material.<!-- Summary End --> It is wrapped in yellow and black striped cellophane-like material and comes with a pull-strip on the base to expose a mildly adhesive base. Each strip is further wrapped in a vacuum-sealed transparent wrapping that also contains two piezo-electric initiator plugs.\n\nThermeld Strips operate in much the same way that Linear burning ropes do, but welding surfaces together in an emergency, rather than cutting them. Thermeld is not a substitute for conventional welding equipment but is a handy emergency substitute.</p>",
