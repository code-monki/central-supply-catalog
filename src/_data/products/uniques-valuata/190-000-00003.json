  "description": "<p><!-- Summary Start -->A ceremonial, iridium cutlass with gold and silver filigrees, worn by Imperial marine officers on formal occasions.<!-- Summary End --> Finely crafted and ornamented. Sharp to a frightening thin- ness. Stronger than steel (will cut TL4 cutlasses with ease). Individualized versions are made by a master craftsman, and are extremely rare. Typically presented as a commemorative item and inscribed with the owner's name, the date of presentation, and the event commemorated. Occasionally it will have slogans or comments engraved as well, e.g. &quot;handle me well, for I was wielded by Emperor Arbellatra in the Year of our Third Imperium 620 when she beheaded the traitorous bastard Gustav.&quot;</p>",
